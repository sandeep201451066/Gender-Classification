# Gender-Classification using Convolutional Neural Network

Gender classification has become relevant to an increasing amount of applications, particularly since the rise of social platforms and social media. we show that by learning representations through the use of deep-convolutional neural networks (CNN) significant increase in performance of classification. We used IMDB-WIKI dataset for gender classification task.
